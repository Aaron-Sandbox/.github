# Hello!

Perhaps you meant to view my [profile page](https://github.com/Auroric)? 

# Aaron's Sandbox
Welcome to my sandbox! This organization primarily consists of:
* Course assignments 
* Experimental code 
* Deprecated and archived projects
Basically, anything I've worked on that isn't showcased on my profile page.

Much of it is not documented, so I wish you luck in your adventures, should you choose to wade into the depths of the unknown. 
Who knows, you might find something useful here! :)
